# ParkChain x DeCharge Hackathon Submission

**Track:** Powering the EVolution on Solana
**Team:** ParkChain
**Project:** Real-World EV Charging Network with Solana Integration

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

Most Web3 users can't directly participate in real EV charging ecosystems. EV drivers who contribute to sustainable energy earn no real-time on-chain recognition or reward for their activity. There's no bridge connecting physical EV charging data with Web3 engagement and token utility.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

**ParkChain** is a comprehensive EV charging platform that bridges real-world charging infrastructure with Solana blockchain:

### Core Features

#### 1. ‚ö° **Live Charging Feed** (`/live-feed`)
- **Real-time visualization** of active charging sessions
- **Live statistics**: Active sessions, energy flowing now, points earned
- **Per-watt billing**: Track energy delivered (kWh) in real-time
- **On-chain integration**: Solana wallet connection via Phantom/Solflare
- **Privacy-first**: Anonymized user data in public feed

**Technical Implementation:**
- Backend endpoint: `GET /api/live-sessions` (public, no auth required)
- Updates every 5 seconds for real-time effect
- Shows: station name, energy delivered, points earning, current cost
- Displays verification status (active, pending verification, completed)

#### 2. üíé **Points Marketplace** (`/marketplace`)
- **50% discount** for Web3 users to buy DeCharge Points (DCP)
- **Earn & Trade**: EV drivers earn 1 DCP per kWh charged
- **Web3 participation**: Users without chargers can support green energy
- **Transparent pricing**: Regular price 1 PLN/DCP ‚Üí Discounted 0.50 PLN/DCP
- **Solana Pay integration** (proof of concept)

**User Stories:**
- ‚úÖ **EV Driver**: "I earn DCP tokens for every kWh I charge, verified on-chain"
- ‚úÖ **Web3 User**: "I buy DCP at 50% discount to participate in EV ecosystem"
- ‚úÖ **Platform**: "We bridge real-world sustainability with blockchain utility"

#### 3. üîí **Anti-Fraud Verification System**
To prevent users from lying about energy consumption:
- User ends charging ‚Üí Status: `pending_verification`
- Owner reviews data from charger display
- Owner can **correct** energy values if user lies
- Only after approval: Connector released, payment processed
- This ensures **honest reporting** backed by physical verification

#### 4. üåê **Complete EV Infrastructure**
- Interactive map with chargers and parking spots
- Session management (start, end, verify)
- Owner dashboards with revenue tracking
- User dashboards with points earned
- Real-time connector availability

## üîó Solana Integration

### Current Implementation

1. **Wallet Connection**
   - Phantom & Solflare support
   - `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`
   - Connected wallet displayed on all DeCharge pages

2. **Points System**
   - 1 DCP token = 1 kWh charged
   - Calculated automatically during session completion
   - Stored in database with `points_earned` field

3. **Marketplace Economy**
   - Regular price: 1.00 PLN per DCP
   - Web3 user price: 0.50 PLN per DCP (50% discount)
   - Proof of concept purchase flow with Solana wallet

### Planned for Production

1. **SPL Token** for DeCharge Points (DCP)
2. **Solana Pay** integration for payments
3. **On-chain session recording** via smart contracts
4. **NFT receipts** for completed charging sessions
5. **Token staking** for charger ownership

## üìä Technical Architecture

### Backend (Node.js + Supabase)
```
POST   /api/charging-sessions          - Start charging session
PUT    /api/charging-sessions/:id/end  - End session (‚Üí pending_verification)
PUT    /api/charging-sessions/:id/verify - Owner verifies & approves
GET    /api/live-sessions               - PUBLIC feed for live data
GET    /api/charging-sessions/my        - User's sessions
```

### Frontend (React + Tailwind + Solana Wallet Adapter)
```
/live-feed         - Real-time charging feed (DeCharge feature)
/marketplace       - Buy DCP tokens at 50% discount (DeCharge feature)
/map               - Interactive map with chargers
/my-chargers       - Owner dashboard with verification
/my-reservations   - User dashboard with points
```

### Database Schema
```sql
charging_sessions {
  id, station_id, user_id,
  start_time, end_time,
  energy_delivered_kwh,    -- Real energy tracked
  points_earned,           -- 1 DCP per kWh
  total_cost,
  status                   -- active | pending_verification | completed
}

charging_stations {
  id, name, address,
  charger_type,            -- AC | DC_FAST | ULTRA_FAST
  max_power_kw,
  price_per_kwh,
  available_connectors
}
```
