### Backend API
```
/backend/routes/parkingMarketplace.js
```
API endpoints:
- `GET /api/parking-marketplace/listings` - Get all listings
- `GET /api/parking-marketplace/stats` - Market statistics
- `POST /api/parking-marketplace/purchase` - Record purchase
- `GET /api/institutional-operators/profile` - Operator profile

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Run the new migration:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d parkchain < database/parking_marketplace.sql
```

This creates all necessary tables, views, functions, and triggers.

### 2. Backend Configuration

The routes are ready to be integrated into your main server.js:

```javascript
// In backend/server.js, add:
const parkingMarketplaceRoutes = require('./routes/parkingMarketplace');
app.use('/api/parking-marketplace', parkingMarketplaceRoutes);
app.use('/api/institutional-operators', parkingMarketplaceRoutes);
```

### 3. Frontend Routes

Already added to `App.jsx`:
- `/parking-marketplace` - Public marketplace
- `/institutional-operator` - Operator dashboard

### 4. Solana Program Deployment (Optional for Hackathon Demo)

For full functionality, deploy the Solana program:

```bash
cd programs/parking-marketplace
anchor build
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

For hackathon demo, the frontend simulates on-chain operations.
