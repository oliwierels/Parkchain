## Slide 1: Title
**Parkchain**
*Tokenizing Urban Infrastructure on Stellar*

🅿️ DePIN Platform for Parking & EV Charging

Built with Scaffold Stellar

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Urban Parking Crisis**
- 🚗 30% of traffic = looking for parking
- 💰 $500B wasted annually in circling time
- 🌍 10M tons of CO2 from parking search

**Infrastructure Investment Gap**
- Cities need $trillions for parking infrastructure
- Small investors can't participate
- No liquidity for infrastructure assets

---

## Slide 3: The Solution
**Parkchain = Blockchain + Real-World Infrastructure**

🏗️ **Tokenize parking spots**
- Cities tokenize infrastructure
- Investors buy tokens
- Earn revenue share

⚡ **Reward EV charging**
- Earn 1 DCP per kWh charged
- Trade tokens on marketplace
- Incentivize sustainable transport

---

## Slide 4: Why Stellar?

**Transaction Costs:**
| Blockchain | Cost per tx | 10K txs/day |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Solana | $0.0005 | $1,825/year |
| **Stellar** | **$0.00001** | **$36/year** |

**98% cheaper!** 💰

**Fast Finality:** 2-5 seconds (vs 12-13s Solana)
**Reliability:** <1% failed txs (vs 15% Solana)

## Appendix: Technical Deep Dive

### Contract Functions

**DCP Token:**
```rust
initialize(admin)
mint(to, amount)
transfer(from, to, amount)
balance(address) → i128
```

**Parking Asset:**
```rust
initialize_asset(...) → asset_id
distribute_revenue(...) → distribution_id
calculate_yield(asset_id) → i128
```

**Marketplace:**
```rust
create_listing(...) → listing_id
buy_asset(...) → trade_id
cancel_listing(listing_id)
```
